## NEXT TIME YOU PUSH
The file "google-service.json" should no longer be tracked on git.
The .gitignore file have been changed, ALTHOUGH!
It's important that you follow these steps before you push the next time.
1. go to the app/ directory in gitbash
2. use command `ls`
3. you should see a file called "google-services.json"
4. use the command `git rm --cached google-services.json`

This last command ensures that the mentioned file is removed from gits tracking system.
